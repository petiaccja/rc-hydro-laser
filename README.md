RC Hydroplane Plan
===

This repository contains 3D CAD files of the design of a laser-cut RC model hydroplane. The files are in *Autodesk Inventor* native format. You can tinker with the *user parameters* in ```base_sketch.ipt``` to change things such as the length of the hull, proportions, and dimensions of main features. You can also specify the thickness of the material you want to laser-cut, or modify the contours of the stingers or bulkheads. Should you limit your changes to relatively small amounts, the whole design will update to follow them. If you add or remove features, you will have to manually fix dependent drawings and extrusions.

It's very much WIP now. I'll update this if it's any ready.
